This is an idea from [Derick Sivers](https://nownownow.com), one of my favorite people. The idea is to add a page to your blog that shows what you're doing at that very moment.

Here's what I'm doing:

 - Writing the next volume of *The Imposter's Handbook* with [Scott Hanselman](https://hanselman.com), which I've [decided to crowd fund](https://bigmachine.io/projects/imposters-handbook-presale/) so I can focus.
 - Working on a contract that allows me to use Ruby again! 
 - Extracting a fun data access tool from that project in the spirit of Massive, called [MassiveRB](https://github.com/robconery/massive-rb). This one is pretty dang fun!
 - Getting settled in Honolulu, where I now live.
