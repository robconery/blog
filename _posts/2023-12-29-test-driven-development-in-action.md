A few years back I recorded a coding session with [Brad Wilson](https://mastodon.social/@bradwilson) where I asked him to do TDD "for real", as if he was at work and not doing a demo... even though he was.

The result is the video below, which was pretty popular on one of my other video sites. It is a bit dated but I don't think the methods changed at all! Hope you enjoy.

It's free, by the way, you just need to [sign in or create an account](#/portal/signup).
