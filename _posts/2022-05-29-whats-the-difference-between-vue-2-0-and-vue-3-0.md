summary: The third version of a framework, library or tool generally sucks, at least in my experience. Will this be the case with Vue 3? Let’s find out!

In this video I look at the main differences between Vue 3 and Vue 2\. I’m happy to report that they are, for the most part, aimed at making things faster, smoother and more straightforward.  
The best changes that I have seen are:

* **Using** Vite as the build tool. This thing is blazing fast which makes all the difference in the world.
* **The creation of Pinia** as a replacement for Vuex. Bigger apps need a centralized state store and I, for one, am happy to see Vuex go away. The Redux-y stuff was just a bit too much.
* **The Composition API**. Almost everything in Vue is now done by importing and executing specific functions that do a single thing. You can still pass objects in the old declarative style, but working with the Composition bits is refreshing.
* **Teleport**! You can now “shove” a component into any DOM element on the page as long as it has a selector.
