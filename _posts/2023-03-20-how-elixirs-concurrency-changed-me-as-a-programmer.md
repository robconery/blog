summary: This is an excerpt for a talk I gave in 2016 at NDC London, featuring Elixir and the concurrency features it has, built in. It's easily the most annoying demo I've ever done...

Back in 2016 I learned the Elixir Programming language and had a blast. I hadn't used any functional languages up until that point so I was as green as green gets. I suppose that was intentional.

## Functional Programmers Can Be Annoying

There's a certain smugness that functional programmers get when you discuss _anything_ language-related. A practiced condescension they wear with great pride, like a yellow hat that only people who wear yellow hats could appreciate.

I don't like the color yellow very much (though it's in the following video quite a lot) and I don't wear hats. I don't quite have the right head for one - but I do like Elixir and despite it's functional roots, I found the community to be full of non-yellow-hat wearers.

You don't need to know what a functor is to use Elixir. Nor do you need to understand monads or mutexes. Eventually it's a good idea to get to know these things, but you can happily jump right in and splash around and no one will come at you with a jargon gun. At least that was my experience.

## Elegant, Fast, Amazing

Elixir flexes the friendly, approachable, bubble-gumminess of Ruby to get around the general faffery of Erlang - all to great effect. You have the entire, mountainous gravity of the BEAM, Erlang's VM, running under the most elegant language I've ever used.

I know, I know. People waxxing on about their new language discovery can be annoying. But this, for me, was one of those "**oh holy shit this is why people pay this much money for these shoes**" moments. My brain just slipped right into this language and wiggled it's neurons happily... and yes, there was a learning curve, but my god... my god...

To top it off, it's one of the most scalable, powerful platforms you can use. What's not to like?

## A Great Language Needs a Shite Demo

I was at NDC London in 2016 and decided to answer a question that I received oftent: 

> I hear you're really into Elixir these days. What's so great about it?

There are so many things... the video below is a 20 minute excerpt (edited down for time) from the talk I gave. The entire talk was about an hour but, to me, this clip captures the essence of why I like this language so much.

Hope you enjoy it!
