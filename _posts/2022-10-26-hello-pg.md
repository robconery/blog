In this video production, created back in 2011, Rob Sullivan (a SQL Server DBA) and I discover PostgreSQL from the perspective of a DBA (Rob) and a developer (me).

This is when I first got to know Postgres and it blew my mind. Keep in mind that Postgres has changed over the years, but so many of the features here are still around. If you're hoping for a quick primer, these videos are for you! **They're free to all, as long as you're a member**!
