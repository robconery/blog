Hey there subscriber friends, this is a note just for you. First: as always **thanks so much** for being a premium subscriber. Your support means a ton to me and honestly keeps me going!

**I'm about to drop a preview of my next Big Effor**t and I wanted to make sure to address any questions you might have about it, so here goes.

## What Is It?

Long story short: **I've been building Vue/Nuxt applications non-stop for the last 6 years** and even shipped one for Microsoft, which was wild! Recently I shipped one for [one of my video apps](https://vue.bigmachine.io,), which was a fascinating study in patience.

I learned a lot **and decided to share**, but I wanted to do it as "real" as I possibly could, so I'm making an "episodic walkthrough", which will be **25-30 videos roughly 30 minutes in length**, lightly edited for pace. I'll build out a video application and treat you like you're pair coding with me.

In addition, I'll be **adding "Case Study" videos**, devoted to a single topic. Things like testing with Playwright, using Firebase, "just show me what I need to know about JavaScript and Typescript" - things like that. Those will be around 1-2 hours apiece, tightly edited and focused.

There are other things to go along with that - but I'll mention that in another post which will be public, and I'll also include a video about what's coming.

In short: _it's a lot_. **A massive brain dump** of everything I've learned about Vue, Nuxt, Vuetify, Firebase and more.

## What You Need to Know

I'm pricing this around $199/$299 **but you, as my subs, won't pay a thing**. I'll send you out a coupon code you can use, if you like, to access the goods. I'll also post a few of the videos here for your access only but the walkthrough will be hosted on another site.

**If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reply.** I'll have another post coming in a few days which will cover things in more detail, so stay tuned.
