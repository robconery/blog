After a good year and a half of editing, polishing and shoving [The Imposter's Handbook](https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook) into shape, **it's now ready for print**. I'm selling it through Blurb print-on-demand [and you can get it here](http://www.blurb.com/b/8278746-the-imposter-s-handbook).

A few things about this.

## Price

It's expensive to print books and I did my best to drive the price as low as I can, but it comes in at $49 USD. That's not that expensive, I suppose, when it comes to print books like this one.

The main reason it's priced this high is because I needed color. Not quite picture book color, but something that would make my stellar drawings look stellar:

I think they look pretty good!

## Length

I trimmed a little here and there to get the book size to fit Blurb's required page limit (480 pages). It's exactly 459 pages in length, in case you're wondering.

## Quality

As I mention, I opted for "Economy Color" paper. I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but it looks pretty damn good! Even the code samples print clearly and legibly.

## Size

I went with 6x9 "Trade Book", which is a bit smaller than normal hardcover books. It fits really well into a bag and looks fashionable too:

## Can I Have \[Discount/Ebook/Something\]

I can't offer any discounts to existing owners of the book as the expense of printing this thing is... expensive. To be honest I would lose money and that's not fun.

Blurb is the seller, however, and they _do_ put on sales from time to time. I wouldn't be surprised if they did something for Black Friday or Cyber Monday. If you want, you can [check my twitterz](https://twitter.com/robconery) and I'll tweet it out if they do.

Regarding the digital version: I don't have access to anyone's information, so there's simply no way to bundle this in. I'm trying to figure out a way to make this happen but so far I've had no luck.

[Hope you enjoy it!](http://www.blurb.com/b/8278746-the-imposter-s-handbook)
