At NDC London I had the chance to sit with Carl and Richard of _.NET Rocks!_ and [record a show](https://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=1516) about my latest book [_A Curious Moon_](https://goo.gl/tWF5HE).

I loved this interview, mostly because Richard is a major space nut and we got to geek out completely on Enceladus, space, and other things.

I always have a great time talking to Carl and Richard and it's crazy to think that _this is the 10th time they interviewed me_! The [first time](https://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=196) was show 196 back in 2006 (12 years ago!).
