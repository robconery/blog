I've been **writing a fun book** over the last few months on **Nuxt 3** and it's based on my experience building out bigmachine.io as well as the individual course sites I have. I've been using Nuxt for years and love it - and Nuxt 3 is particularly exciting because it's both **faster and simpler**.

One of the things I wanted to dig into was the server that powers Nuxt: [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io). Nuxt 3 behaves a bit differently than Nuxt 2, and I wanted to know why. Specifically:

* The routing is different. You used to use an `_` for the dynamic routes, now you use square braces `[]`.
* The serverside routes are _ridiculously terse_, which I absolutely love.
