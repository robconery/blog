🙌🏼 Thanks for signing up to the blog!

Here are 9 videos (out of 34) from the [_Computer Science Fundamentals_](//products/imposter-video/) course that you can find here on my blog. I made these videos to complement the book, and I also added a few things that weren't in the book... but that made me kind of happy.

Here's a tip: pay good attention to tree traversal stuff! I've interviewed at Google 3 times over my career, and the first two featured two tree questions apiece.

Enjoy!
