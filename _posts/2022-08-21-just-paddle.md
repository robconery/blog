summary: I really think too much. I have a lot of fear in me that keeps me from doing things I love to do. It's unhealthy and also self-obsessive (there are 3 "I's" and 2 "me's" above). I really need to stop thinking and just... do...

I have the hardest time starting things. Like this post, for instance. I'll just sit there and think... _and think_... which is funny because if you know me personally you might say something like "really, Rob? You... _think_ too much?"

Riding waves is so much like life. I don't think I need to explain this too much - but often the hardest thing to do when surfing is _paddling_. Making the decision to go and then committing 100% to whatever happens. 

**That's the irony**. I love to try things, change my mind, race around, zig and zag... you get the idea. I'm an optimizer. It's my thing.

Unfortunately I also tend to overthink things and don't even start the race. Take this blog, for instance. **I've wanted to create something simple, where I can post ideas and long-form "tutorials"** if you will, but every time I think about it I lock up, trying to optimize what I'll create, how it will be presented, etc.

## People Like What I Create

Which is a problem. I've been making videos for years - [even sold a company once](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwja0qax0Nb5AhX7HTQIHSljA10QFnoECAgQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crunchbase.com%2Forganization%2Ftekpub&usg=AOvVaw2jyToKdVO1oOYh4moi5lhX). I write books, [one of which has sold almost 30,000 copies](//products/the-imposters-handbook/), self published!  
I research something, get excited when it works and then get even more excited when I see connections to other things I've learned. I take notes, make some demos and in 3-6 months I might have a video I can sell. Or maybe I'll take a year and write a book!

I like writing. I like making videos. **I don't like how long it takes so I end up just giving up** or doing less so it doesn't take a ton of time... with the videos ending up on YouTube.

There has to be a happy middle ground where I can do good, valuable work that people are willing to pay for without becoming a cheesy cloud coach guru. I don't mind giving things away, but if I'm getting paid to do it I'll make 10x the content in terms of quality and quantity.

But how do I go about that? What types of things will I create... how will I present this to people? _I need to think about this..._

## Or Maybe I Don't

The domain for this site, _robconery.com_, seems pretty obvious for someone like me because that's my name. The problem is that I have a hard time with attention and I very much don't want to give the impression of trying to be a "guru". **So I spent 3 days (literally) pondering domain names.** It had to be _just right_ so people didn't get the impression I was full of myself.

_What a load of shit_. I mean... I do good work! People like what I do (see above) so why shouldn't I be OK with doing more of it in a place with my name on it? I'm not a guru, I'm an explorer and hopefully that will come across in everything I do here.

Or maybe I just stop thinking about it and _just do it already._

**I want a place where I can stop thinking and just do things for fun**. A long trek through the world of travel, software, whatever. I plan on discovering some fun stuff along the way and if you decide to join, I hope you find it valuable.

If not, that's OK too. I'll keep writing nonetheless and I can think this thing to death and sit here and tell you what my plans are but honestly I have no idea.

Big wave, might be too big, or maybe close out. Let's find out and _just paddle_.
