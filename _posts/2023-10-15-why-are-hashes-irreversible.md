summary: How to explain hashing algorithms to 5-year olds? Well... I'll do my best in this post, which comes with a video too!

I was reading Twitter/X the other day when I came across a compelling question from [Kevin Naughton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gIi6UK6w4Q):

> someone pls explain how hashing algorithms like SHA-256 are irreversible like i'm 5 years old

This is a wonderful question and, to be honest, something I didn't understand until a few years ago when I wrote part 2 of [_The Imposter's Handbook_](https://sales.bigmachine.io/imposter-second). 

As you can see, Kevin got a lot of replies and, if I'm honest, there seems to be a lot of confusion. Old Rob might take up the challenge here, striking up some exciting conversation on Twitter about the nature of one-way functions... but let's be positive and dig in to some details.

## The Enemy Knows the System

There are a lot of very wrong replies to Keven's tweet and I don't want to call anyone out, but I will say that the theme of wrongness goes something like this:

> I have a bunch of things and if I scramble those things up and give them to you, you'll have no way to unscramble them.

There were examples of candy, cake, a deck of cards, and so on and many of them made sense in a human way. I wouldn't want to unshuffle a deck of cards or unbake a cake! 

But see here's the thing: if I know the result (a lovely cake) and your _exact_ process, which I will because these are algorithms after all that _must_ produce the exact same result - then it's possible for me to figure out the initial ingredients - easily I might add. It might take a while and some guessing, but in short order I _will_ produce the exact same cake.

**When you bake a cake or shuffle cards, you're doing _encryption_**: turning one value into another following a process. 

Hashing, on the other hand, is completely different. **Hashing turns some value into an unrelated number using functions that you can't reverse** \- this last bit is the thing I think most commenters were missing. 

## What's a One-way Function?

Let's take our cake's individual ingredients and weigh them on a scale that only counts up to 11 grams and then starts again at 0:

Some ingredients will weigh more than 11 grams, of course, but you would still record the number you see on the dial. For instance: 35o grams of flour would spin this dial around quite a few times before ultimately landing on the number 9.

This is a _modular_ operation; `350 mod 11` to be specific:

350 mod 11

Now, imagine that I do the same for every ingredient and record what the dial says using my `mod 11` scale, and then write that number down. It might end up being something like:

```
Sugar: 4
Flour: 9
Eggs: 3
Oil: 3
Vanilla: 10
Milk: 3
Salt: 0
Butter: 8
Baking Powder: 4
```

Now we have a number we can play with, or _compress_, in our hashing algorithm: `4933103084`. How did we get this number? Well you just saw me do it, but there's no way you could reliably figure out my ingredients list from here!

## Hey, It's a Video!

Want to see more? I made a video about all of this and I do hope you enjoy...
