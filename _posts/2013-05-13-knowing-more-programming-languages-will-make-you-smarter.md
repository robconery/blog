title: Knowing More Programming Languages Will Make You Smarter
summary: "There's a thought in neuroscience/psychological circles that words are much more than sounds that represent things: they are the abstraction of our higher brain function. Words are language, code is language. Restricting yourself to one or two languages is limiting your cognitive abilities"

## Words as a Conceptual Map
There's a small bit of setup here - bear with me. [I relistened to one of my favorite RadioLab podcasts ('Words')](http://www.radiolab.org/2010/aug/09/) this weekend and had my mind blown, once again. They dug into **what words mean** to us and, according to the show, words are much more than expression vehicles.

**Words are the very structure of our higher reasoning**.

In other words: _if you can't say it, you can't think it._ The words themselves are cognitive variables strung together to represent feeling, emotion, memory - abstract things made concrete by the words we put to them.

High-minded stuff and rather than regurgitate the whole show here - go listen if you haven't, it's very good. It left me quite inspired and I wondered if the the ideas in the show could extend to programming languages. Why not? Code is simply syntax laid on top of process that a machine needs to understand... hmmm....

We tell machines how to think - which directly reflects how we think. Writing code always seemed like such a "machine-y" thing to do, but I think that's not the case: **Programming languages are true languages** written for us to describe problems that a machine can understand.

These languages are stripped of nuance and imbued with functionality (loops, terse conditionals) for a myriad of problems. _How well do you speak code?_

## A Thought Experiment
Code is language, and how we solve problems with a given programming language directly relates to **how we think in that language**. This doesn't seem like an amazing revelation in and of itself - in fact I think you probably already understood this quite well.

But what if we reversed it? What if you couldn't think any other way - other than what that language _allowed you to think_. What if your coding language of choice **was the abstraction over your programming thought process** - that you actually lacked the mental faculties that lie outside of what that language can represent?

Let's say you walk into an interview and you get hit with a classic interview question (no, not FizzBuzz): **write a routine that spits out Fibonacci numbers**. It's something every dev has had to do at some point.

Now, slow your brain down and rewind. What language are you using to express this? What is that language **allowing you to do**.

If the only programming language you know is C# you're probably writing some LINQ in your mind and running a modulus. If you use Javascript you're probably doing something similar but maybe spread over two functions utilizing callbacks. 

Rubyists out there might do something similar - favoring a more idiomatic approach with blocks/yield rather than a terse one-liner.

**Now write it using a Monad**.

**Recursion?**

I'm sure a few of my readers could do all the above (LINQ, callbacks/blocks, Monad and Recursion) but I doubt that most of you can. This is due to the languages you know, the idioms they use, and **the way those languages allow you to think about a problem**.

## Expanding Your Thought Process
I don't know anything about monads but I've done recursive programming in the past (sometimes not-intentionally). When I started using Ruby, I began to value the idiom of passing control back and forth using blocks and yield. You can do this in many languages - but for some reason it wasn't something I routinely did in C#.

The asynchronous nature of Javascript has awakened a part of my mind to evented programming. Again you can do this in many languages but it's idiomatic in Javascript and Node.

I can "think" in these terms and solve problems in ways I could never do when I knew only one language well (C#). At the time I liked the idea of "going deep" - of knowing a language so thoroughly that I could solve any problem with it and not clutter my mind with the different syntaxes of other languages.

I'm glad I didn't. And listening to that Radiolab podcast this last weekend made me understand why. I used to think it was that learning new languages would help me "think differently" but now I know it's more than that: **I'm smarter now**.

I'm not an egotistical guy and it hurts a bit to write that last paragraph - as if I'm suggesting that I'm smarter than people who know only one programming language - **which is clearly not true**. My point is only that _I'm smarter than I was 4 years ago_ and the reason I think that is because I can solve problems in more ways than I could before and if my definition of "intellect" is accurate...

![Definition of 'Intellect'](/img/intellect.png)

... then yeah: I think it's OK to say I'm smarter than I was with respect to programming.

The thing I enjoy most about all of this is that I would never have thought about this until I heard that Radiolab podcast. They put the words to the very idea that words are our higher reasoning.

A lovely bit of recursive fun.

**Would I have recognized that recursion a few years ago? Hmmmm....**
