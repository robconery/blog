summary: Can a blog be turned into a book? Yes! But it can't be just any old blog - the writer has to have something to say and no fear of saying it... like Troy Hunt. Here's the story of how I turned his blog into a book.      
---

Four years ago I was reading [Troy Hunt's blog](https://www.troyhunt.com/pwned-the-book-is-finally-here/) thinking: "this guy can _write_". **Good writing is all about being truthful** \- true to yourself, the story you're writing, and most of all true to your readers. **Troy's posts are a masterclass** in _laying it out there_ in the most honest, unvarnished way possible.

Anyway, the next thing that hit me was _**this dude should write a book**_. Of course I thought that, I like writing. But so must Troy because some of his posts are epic!

Some of his posts... are... epic... ðŸ¤”.   _I wonder if I could turn his blog into a book somehow..._

I'm not the first person with this idea - in fact there are entire businesses devoted to doing just that. In fact, _The Martian_ started out life as a series of blog posts by Andy Weir and was later turned into a book which, I hear, did pretty well.

## What If We Made Something More?

For anyone but the author, **the best part of a blog post is the comments section**. I don't need to explain this to you - there's always drama, criticism and, occasionally, a nugget of gold. 

What if we wrote a book that added the comments but scrubbed away the nonsense? I could curate that I think.

The idea took hold in me and I couldn't stop thinking about it. I started combing through Troy's blog for posts that I thought would fit an interesting story arc, which could be the rise of his career, the start of [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/), and his new life to come.

Then I read his post about [leaving Pfizer](https://www.troyhunt.com/today-marks-two-important-milestones/), to go out on his own. This is how the post ended:

> Iâ€™m enormously excited by whatâ€™s happening next. The experiences at Pfizer have shaped that future and exiting in this fashion is the best result I could ever have hoped for. Iâ€™ll follow up with another post as the dust settles on this outgoing phase of my life, Iâ€™m _enormously_ excited about whatâ€™s coming next!

People knew who Troy was in 2015 - he released HaveIBeenPwned 2 years prior. But he wasn't the Troy of today, which got me thinking...

## Let's Add Some Perspectives

**I picked 36 or so posts that I thought told a great story** and read well, and then I proposed the idea to Troy: _let's compile your posts into a book. I'll curate the comments and add them too - you write introductions and epilogues for each post, giving a "behind the scenes" feel to it_.

This is Troy's response, verbatum:

> Youâ€™ve done a great job with the Imposterâ€™s Handbook and whilst this is a very different beast, I know the TLC youâ€™ve applied to that. If it was anyone else suggesting this, I probably wouldnâ€™t even reply to the email!

Wow. It's true - I put _everything_ into the books and videos I create - podcasts too. I better not mess this up...

## And It's Alive...

After four years, we launched the book.

[PWNEDIn 2015 Troy Hunt left a well-paying career at one of the largest companies in the world. He created a blog and set about building a career in online security, working for himself![](https://bigmachine.io/images/logos/cs.png)Big Machine![](https://bigmachine.io/images/pwned/cover.jpg)](https://bigmachine.io/products/pwned/)

Right now, as I write this, **I'm a bit numb**. I mean - it's not like I spent every waking moment on this thing, but it's always been there. Something I would spend an hour on here and there. Troy, Charlotte and I would get on a video call periodically to talk about this post or that, how to order things, formatting issues and so on.

I miss that. It's like watching your kid go off to college which I had to do two years ago. You're so excited for their new life - one that's going to be so much fun and open so many doors... but then... that's your baby heading out the door and into their life.

Troy's book means a lot to me and you can read why in the first few pages, where I took the liberty of explaining the intensely personal reasons as to why I put so much care into this thing. We all did, and I think this review captures it:

> **Love, love, LOVE the intros** ... in particular Rob Conery ... fantastic and really anchor an emotional aspect to the book, that i was not expecting. Great to see a book deliver this authenticity - we're all only human after all!. I "cheated" and also skipped to read Charlotte's epilogue and again was blown away by the depth and genuine nature of the emotion on display. **I honestly was not expecting there to be so much heart on display, but am very glad there is**.

Troy and I faced the biggest challenges of our lives, oddly at the same time. Creating this book was a necessary thing, for both of us. 

## Not Just Any Old Blog

You can't run a scraper over a random blog, output as a PDF and call it a day. The person behind the blog needs to be authentic and "write true". They also should have something to say and not be afraid to say it. If I'm honest, I can't think of many blogs that fit that profile.

If you do find one, however, it's a treasure. Each post anchors a larger story that, to me, makes the blog come alive with historical meaning. This comment from Henk Brink captures that:

> **I haven't been able to put the book down**. The added intros and epilogue on each post in particular and the retrospectives from today's perspective are particularly interesting...

If you're up for a fun read into the lively career of Troy Hunt, [well here you go](https://bigmachine.io/products/pwned/). We put a lot of life in there, and I do hope you enjoy it.

I do hope to do another project like this, and I have a few names in mind - but if you have a suggestion, hit me up on Twitter or, if you're a subscriber here, leave a comment below.
