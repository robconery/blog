summary: There are too many crappy demos out there. It just takes a little extra time and some empathy to tie your tutorial to a real problem.

A few weeks ago I asked a simple question on Twitter:

> If you’ve been thinking about learning SQL but didn’t or haven’t, what’s stopping you? Would love to know more :) light me up!

The responses were mixed, but a friend of mine confided in me that SQL is just plain boring. The syntax is weird and they just couldn't see why they would use it vs. an ORM.

## This is a Real Problem

This is a real bug of mine: people who want to teach other people something seem content to use the most meaningless, ridiculous examples!

I remember trying to learn React from a popular paid tutorial site and the author completely phoned in the demo application, calling it exactly that! With super exciting component names like `MyComponent` that `foo` property and `bar` method.

If you're a content producer: please take a little extra time to find something relevant and meaningful. Draw on your own experience and show how you solved something! 

## It's Keeping People From Learning

This lack of effort when it comes to demo material is harmful to people who try to learn. Take SQL for instance - the most commonly used data set (that I've seen) is [DVD Rental](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/). This is crazy-making because:

* Who rents DVDs anymore? I'm sure there are some people, sure, but come on! We can do better.
* The schema is so completely unreal it boggles my mind. I could go off on everything wrong with it but please, trust me, it's completely made up and ridiculous.
* Did you even try to find something relevant and real?

That last one gets me and yes, I do realize it's a peave I have that I should probably let go of.

But here, let's try it together. Google "[Real World Datasets](https://www.google.com/search?q=real+world+datasets)." The results are pretty good:

One of the links you'll end up at is Kaggle, one of my favorite data sites:

## There Is a Wealth of Real World Stuff Out There In The Real World

OK, I'm done ranting! I have been meaning to create a SQL resource for people who want to get started with database "stuff". As mentioned above, people just won't care if they can't see the value of a tool to the things they actually care about.

Given that it's the start of the American football season and that I have quite a few friends trying to figure out who to start on their fantasy football team - I figured that this would make a pretty [damn good SQL tutorial](https://bigmachine.io/little-sql-book/).

Turns out it did! I've had over 120 downloads in the last 24 hours, and that's just announcing it on Twitter.

I found [my data set](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mur418/2020-fantasy-football) on Kaggle, which I liked as it was concise and simple to work with. As you might imagine, this data can be intense! I just wanted something in summary for that could be used for a draft cheatsheet.

If you're interested in SQL, [go have a look](https://bigmachine.io/little-sql-book/)! It's 70 pages long and absolutely free.
